                <div id="answer">Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.

                <div id="answer">COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. COVID-19 is now a pandemic affecting many countries globally.

                <h4 id="question">What are the symptoms of Covid-19?  <i  style="font-size:18px; color:blue; background-color: rgb(195, 218, 240); cursor: pointer;" class="fa">&#xf067;</i></h4>
                <div id="answer">The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, and tiredness. Other symptoms that are less common and may affect some patients include aches and pains, nasal congestion, headache, conjunctivitis, sore throat, diarrhea, loss of taste or smell or a rash on skin or discoloration of fingers or toes. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but only have very mild symptoms.
                  <br/>
                  <br/>
                   Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing hospital treatment. Around 1 out of every 5 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart and lung problems, diabetes, or cancer, are at higher risk of developing serious illness.  However, anyone can catch COVID-19 and become seriously ill.  People of all ages who experience fever and/or  cough associated withdifficulty breathing/shortness of breath, chest pain/pressure, or loss of speech or movement should seek medical attention immediately. If possible, it is recommended to call the health care provider or facility first, so the patient can be directed to the right clinic.

                <h4 id="question">What should i do if i have Covid-19 symptoms and when should i seek a medical care?  <i  style="font-size:18px; color:blue; background-color: rgb(195, 218, 240); cursor: pointer;" class="fa">&#xf067;</i></h4>
                <div id="answer">If you have minor symptoms, such as a slight cough or a mild fever, there is generally no need to seek medical care. Stay at home, self-isolate and monitor your symptoms. Follow national guidance on self-isolation.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    However, if you live in an area with malaria or dengue fever it is important that you do not ignore symptoms of fever.  Seek medical help.  When you attend the health facility wear a mask if possible, keep at least 1 metre distance from other people and do not touch surfaces with your hands. If it is a child who is sick help the child stick to this advice.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Seek immediate medical care if you have difficulty breathing or pain/pressure in the chest. If possible, call your health care provider in advance, so he/she can direct you to the right health facility.

                <h4 id="question">
                    Can COVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?   
                    <i  style="font-size:18px; color:blue; background-color: rgb(195, 218, 240); cursor: pointer;" class="fa">&#xf067;</i>
                </h4>
                <div id="answer">COVID-19 is mainly spread through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing or has other symptoms such as fever or tiredness. Many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true in the early stages of the disease. It is possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has just a mild cough and does not feel ill.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Some reports have indicated that people with no symptoms can transmit the virus. It is not yet known how often it happens. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the topic and will continue to share updated findings.
                </div>

                <h4 id="question">What does it mean to self-isolate?  <i  style="font-size:18px; color:blue; background-color: rgb(195, 218, 240); cursor: pointer;" class="fa">&#xf067;</i></h4>
                <div id="answer">
                    Self-isolation is an important measure taken by those who have COVID-19 symptoms to avoid infecting others in the community, including family members.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Self-isolation is when a person who is experiencing fever, cough or other COVID-19 symptoms stays at home and does not go to work, school or public places. This can be voluntarily or based on his/her health care provider’s recommendation. However, if you live in an area with malaria or dengue fever it is important that you do not ignore symptoms of fever. Seek medical help. When you attend the health facility wear a mask if possible, keep at least 1 metre distant from other people and do not touch surfaces with your hands. If it is a child who is sick help the child stick to this advice.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    If you do not live in an area with malaria or dengue fever please do the following:
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                     -  If a person is in self-isolation, it is because he/she is ill but not severely ill (requiring medical attention)
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                       <li>have a large, well-ventilated with hand-hygiene and toilet facilities</li>
                       <li>If this is not possible, place beds at least 1 metre apart</li>
                       <li>Keep at least 1 metre from others, even from your family members</li>
                       <li>Monitor your symptoms daily</li>
                       <li>Isolate for 14 days, even if you feel healthy</li>
                       <li>If you develop difficulty breathing, contact your healthcare provider immediately – call them first if possible</li>
                       <li>Stay positive and energized by keeping in touch with loved ones by phone or online, and by exercising yourself at home.</li>
